Any negative connotations you\u2019re reading into the comp as an indictment of Shenault\u2019s NFL career are your own.\n\nAgain, let\u2019s make that simple: *a comp is intended to reference play style, not career success. It compares a player\u2019s tape coming into the pros to another player you might be familiar with in the pros.* \n\nIn this case, there were a lot of similarities between Shenault\u2019s Colorado tape and Patterson\u2019s Tennessee tape. Let me know if I need to simplify the concept of a comp further.\n\nI\u2019ll reiterate again what I\u2019ve said already. I liked Shenault coming out of college. I had him ranked above guys like Tee Higgins, Jalen Reagor, KJ Hamler, and Chase Claypool. If I thought he was a for sure bust like you\u2019re insinuating, I clearly wouldn\u2019t have ranked him that highly. I\u2019m merely pointing out a similar play style between his game and Cordarelle\u2019s. It\u2019s not some \u201clazy\u201d take, and in my humble opinion, it\u2019s not all that far off of you go watch Cordarelle in college. Are there differences? Yes.

Stickers, squishy stuff, glove turkeys, bunker buddies, and going through mom make things so much less dramatic.  Cartoons? Favorite game?

They love it and it makes up for my mediocre interactions.\n\nTeens, find common ground, you are one too lol.\n\nMiddle aged people, I don't really know. I just act natural and it seems to go great most of the time. Other times people become obsessed with how old I am.  Someone might be 95 and have landed on Normandy beach in a hail of gunfire at 17 years old, and have no problem with me driving an ambulance.  45 year old karen seems to be so worried that I'm the same age as her oldest son, and can't possibly be ready to work on an ambulance and \"SEE BLOOD\".  If you figure out a response to this one let me know, 'cause I haven't yet.\n\nOld people, how many kids, how long did you live here, do you like it, tell me about your kids (they LOVE this one usually), military service? Thanks for your service.  What'd you do?\n\nAll people like compliments.  I like your sweater! Those are sweet shoes.  Is this your dog? He's SO cute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't ask this while the patient is about to fucking die ofc, but with time you'll realize even a busy 911 system is 80% gurney uber and as long as you can turn the call quickly, hit all your key steps, and multitask, you'll have lots of time left to be friendly too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith psych patients, if they REALLY want to talk about it I'll have a heart to heart with them.  Otherwise I usually just try to lighten the mood, and get them to smile.  They are having a terrible time, and EVERYONE they're about to see is gonna ask them a million questions. I usually just try to give them an emotional break.

There\u2019s very little chance that Vassell busts, and he has the chance to be a more valuable NBA player than a lot of the players taken ahead of him.

If Suzanne died at the home--for any reason--and he wanted to bury her, the home is the fastest, easiest, closest, most secure place possible. Who's going to go looking for a Forest Service road, miles out of town, and then wander up there in a pickup not knowing what they'll find!?! A bunch of kids, say, having a party in the woods. Also, you don't risk anything on your property because it's ... YOUR property. You probably KNOW who will visit unexpectedly, when they'll visit, how often folks visit, etc. And this is (IMO) a rather impulsive thing to do; you don't have time to plan, survey, scout, etc. You just want to rid yourself of evidence AND you own property. Also, do you want to drive around with GPS pinging off cell phone towers, etc.? At home, it's just you and the land and \"the job\" you have to do. Sooooo, it's certainly not a bad theory. Again, in my opinion. And, personally, I think Barry \"just got lucky.\" There happened to be no blood, he had time, his girls were gone, they live in the country, and maybe there weren't that many tracks to cover--you know? Suzanne is texting on her phone, the texting stops. What's to cover up?!?!? If there's no mistress, there's even less to cover up. I do think, for what it's worth, that Suzanne will be found. It'll be something you can't even imagine--the city, say, decides to run a gas main out the highway and into homes--and they dig. Or maybe the house catches fire, it gets demolished, and then the owners  build a new one, a larger one, and a foundation is dug. Etc.

I'm definitely going to say HotS doesn't seem to be the worst one; you're likely to run into the same thing when 5 stack queuing in DotA, because people who have 2k MMR friends will make a new account and play with them. It'd be like sending in Bronze/Silver teams against each other with Master tier players mixed in in HotS; it's just as bad.\n\nI'm not sure why people smurf in HotS(Recently came back to pick up the game and mostly solo/duo queue, since DotA's on an update lull and it's my main MOBA), but in DotA the people smurfing are selling accounts/boosting most of the time if they're smurfing ranked(Usually from poorer countries where 50$ USD goes a longer way). Having a phone requirement only stops the people who are interested in playing ranked *and* stomping, and they can just go to the casual mode and do the same thing, so it's not a great solution. Some people even buy very low MMR accounts to smurf their way up if they want to stomp in ranked; if you're middle-class it's not hugely expensive, you can even get an average account for 30$, and it only drops as you go lower since they can automate the process of tanking MMR via bots(For reference Immortal or 'pro' level accounts are like 200$+).\n\nThe potential solutions they're working on are basically making it so that if your main account is toxic and you make a smurf, it'll inherent that toxic behavior score(Meaning it's easier to mute you, put you into a queue for poorly behaved players, etc), and they're trying to funnel smurfs to fight against each other rather than entering new player queues.\n\nThere are definitely some changes that you can do to work on solving the problem(Frankly I think a zero tolerance policy for smurfing is a start), but DotA isn't exactly revolutionizing since there's no tribunal/community based disciplining system like League/CSGO have, which can help root out the problem when someone is obviously playing at high skill level on a new account."}, {"text": "If you have any problems just come to the forum, we'll help you out!"}, {"text": "Mero already calling him DOUBLETOPPIN \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"}, {"text": "Labels print using smartphones with a scan of the upc and the press of a few touchscreen \"buttons\"."}]}

Any negative connotations you\u2019re reading into the comp as an indictment of Shenault\u2019s NFL career are your own.\n\nAgain, let\u2019s make that simple: *a comp is intended to reference play style, not career success. It compares a player\u2019s tape coming into the pros to another player you might be familiar with in the pros.* \n\nIn this case, there were a lot of similarities between Shenault\u2019s Colorado tape and Patterson\u2019s Tennessee tape. Let me know if I need to simplify the concept of a comp further.\n\nI\u2019ll reiterate again what I\u2019ve said already. I liked Shenault coming out of college. I had him ranked above guys like Tee Higgins, Jalen Reagor, KJ Hamler, and Chase Claypool. If I thought he was a for sure bust like you\u2019re insinuating, I clearly wouldn\u2019t have ranked him that highly. I\u2019m merely pointing out a similar play style between his game and Cordarelle\u2019s. It\u2019s not some \u201clazy\u201d take, and in my humble opinion, it\u2019s not all that far off of you go watch Cordarelle in college. Are there differences? Yes.

If he is the first type, it is very easy to buy him something 'wrong,' especially if you don't know model trains yourself.\n\nI saw what you said about 'universally desired' stuff, what about tools? Does he do a lot of work building kits, scenery, or anything else? MicroMark has a holiday catalog (I got it the other week) that has some cool specialty tool for model builders. They are a small-tools company/retailer of other model companies. Maybe you could get him some power tool accessory or workbench organizer. Small Drill bits, 90 degree clamps, detail chisels, there are lots of unique little things on MicroMark. \n\nIs he tech-inclined? Maybe a 3D printer. The Anycubic Photon is one of the most popular printers for hobbyists, and it's on sale on their website right now.

They are not good, but in countries with extreme poverty they have been a way for many people to slowly claw their way out of it. \n\nIt is extremely privileged bullshit for people living in wealthy nations that can afford to pay their workers well to attack the concept of sweatshop work as a whole.\n\nSure, they might involve slave labor or other unsavory elements, but if they let someone earn 10 cents an hour instead of 1 cent an hour - it is a benefit to the worker. We should be trying to give people the best economic lives possible, and going after developing nations for mistreatment of workers is often very misguided.\n\nIn short: as you said, they are sometimes just the best of bad options.

Giambattista Basile's version called Sun, Moon, and Talia have her wake up because one of her nursing twins starts sucking on her finger instead of her nip and sucks out the evil splinter that cursed her.\n\n&gt;After the birth of a great lord's daughter, Talia, wise men and astrologers cast the child's horoscope and predicted that Talia would be endangered by a splinter of flax. To protect his daughter, the father commands that no flax would ever be brought into his house. Years later, Talia sees an old woman spinning flax on a spindle. She asks the woman if she can stretch the flax herself, but as soon as she begins to spin, a splinter of flax goes under her fingernail, and she drops to the ground, apparently dead. Unable to stand the thought of burying his child, Talia's father puts his daughter in one of his country estates.\n\n&gt;Some time later, a king who is out hunting in the nearby woods, follows his falconinto the house. He finds Talia; overcome by her beauty, he tries unsuccessfully to wake her, and then rapes her. He lifted her in his arms, and carried her to a bed, where he gathered the first fruits of love.\"  Afterwards, he leaves the girl on her bed and returns to his own city. Still deep in sleep, nine months after the incident, Talia becomes pregnant and gives birth to twins, (a boy and a girl). One day, the girl cannot find her mother's breast; instead she begins to suck on Talia's finger and draws the flax splinter out. Talia awakens immediately and names her beloved children Sun and Moon, and lives with them in the house.\n\n&gt;The king returns and to find Talia awake and that he is the father to her twins. The two fall in love, however the king is already married, and one night he calls out the names of Talia, Sun, and Moon in his sleep. His wife, the queen, hears him and she forces the king's secretary to tell her everything, and then, using a forged message, has Talia's children brought to court. She orders the cook to kill the children and serve them to the king. But the cook hides them, rather cooking two lambs instead. The queen taunts the king while he eats the meal, unaware of the cook's exchange.\n\n&gt;Then, the queen brings Talia to court. She commands that a huge fire be lit in the courtyard, and that Talia be thrown into the flames. Talia asks to take off her fine garments first. The queen agrees. Talia undresses and utters screams of grief with each piece of clothing. The king hears Talia's screams and goes to her, where his wife tells him that Talia will be burned and that he has unknowingly eaten his own children. The king commands that his wife, his secretary, and the cook be thrown into the fire instead. But, the cook explains how he had saved Sun and Moon, and fed the King two lambs instead. Talia and the king marry, and the cook is rewarded with the title of royal chamberlain.\n\n\n&gt;The last line of the fairy tale \u2013 its moral \u2013 is as follows: \"He who has luck may go to bed, And bliss will rain upon his head.\""}, {"text": "You realize that there were only 9 comments directly connected to my post.

However, I do acknowledge that this doesn't mean it's not the case.  The subject of the following questions isn't a case for an Abrahamic God being the reason or source of an objective morality either.  I think there would need to be a completely separate discussion for analyzing how/where objective morality might originate from.\n\nMy questions are:  \"How are your convictions formed?\" and \"What are your thought processes for forming opinions on moral issues?\"   \n\nTo expand on that a bit, for me personally, I feel like holding a subjective morality perspective would make it very difficult for me to hold any convictions.  If someone came up to me and asked me to donate money to some sort of charitable cause (let's say, support for victims of sex slavery) if I believed in some objective morality and came to a conclusion that the sex slave trade is wrong under all circumstances, I would feel convicted to donate.  \n\nLet's say in the same scenario, I believed in subjective morality instead.  What convictions would I have on the matter?  I feel like I'd have to say \"Well, sex slavery maybe FEELS wrong to me.  But at the same time, maybe it doesn't feel wrong to the people engaged in the sex slave trade.  So who am I to say whether sexy slavery should be allowed or not?\"  \n\nSo then what do you do?  This leads me to that second question. \n What is the guiding force behind the decision making in this situation?  Or do you just punt on any difficult moral question?  I feel like if you don't believe in some sort of objective morality to aim toward, then any decision essentially becomes arbitrary or even...pointless?  \n\nSorry if I'm not being clear at all but I'm hoping some back and forth will provide more concrete things to expand upon."}]}

But what happened instead is, companies treat payroll as an expense, and workers are resources to be managed and spent, not people with an interest in the success of the company (unless they are stupid in the opposite way from my dear communist friends).\n\nI am not saying that all companies ought to adopt a certain model of doing things, or that we the people should use the government to punish companies that don't do things the way I want. But I am suggesting that, as new companies experiment with different methods of corporate structures, perhaps we could discuss compensating employees in a way that does not alienate them from their jobs.\n\nWhat I WOULD like to do as we the people is use the government to reduce the cost of living for citizens, so that they aren't shackled to their jobs like a bunch of slaves. That would go a long way. Health care, social safety net, public transportation, and education, all funded or subsidized by the government. That would open up opportunities for the entire nation to grow and develop a healthy economy that works for EVERYONE."}]}

Large companies like Amazon are capable of charging much lower prices because they have the ability to mass produce and influence markets. This same argument applies to other companies also owned by billionaires. A weeks worth of food from Walmart is significantly cheaper than a weeks worth of food from a farmers market. Literally every single product or service we need to survive, is much cheaper when buying from a large company owned by a billionaire. This is only compounded when companies like Amazon do everything in their power to crush competitors and keep monopolies. Buying from billionaires isn't optional for the vast majority of people, because they physically can't afford not to. Once companies and individuals reach such an astronomical level of wealth the playing field is no longer level. A single private citizen like Jeff Bezos is responsible for supplying essential products for tens of millions of people.

It's often stated explicitly by feminists that homophobia is derived from misogyny. Intersectionality in practice means everyone arguing that their pet identity project is at the root of every form of bigotry. Basically, oppression is genealogical and can be traced back to one ur-oppression (but not class oppression, obviously.)\n\nThe other guy probably doesn't think all gay men are feminine, but instead takes the standard idpol approach, where dealing with the most oppressed subgroup's problems will magically solve everyone else's problems. So if flamboyant/femme gay men are the most hated by society, then the most important thing to do is insist that no one ever say a word against flamboyance. Once nobody cares about gay men being flamboyant (or with the above, once sexism ceases to exist), homophobia will evaporate entirely. \n\nIt's rare that these two components fit together so well as they do here, probably because feminism is well-developed compared to johnny-come-latelys like trans idpol. The genealogical account here is: Men hate women, so men hate men who remind them of women (flamboyant gay men), which further trickles out to men who don't remind them of women but who share traits (gayness) with the men who do. It's six degrees of femininity, rather than \"all gay man are feminine.\"\n\nAnyway, this was the funniest fight I've seen on stupidpol in ages.

This feels like an okay match-up and a \"safe one\" in a way, but at that point, I might as well just role Saints.\n\n**Falcons D/ST**-  Okay, so this is my  hot pick idea.  The thought here is Jameis will probably keep the Saints scoring, but he also is very prone to INTs to at least make up for some of the points lost for that.  This is also the same reason why im shying away from NO D/ST as they may be put in bad field position by Jameis and ATL has the tools to punish them for that.  It all hinges that Jameis plays how he has in the past.  I fully see that this is a very boom/bust pick idea though as it stands right now."}]}

There's nothing sinister about a Utopian vision in itself: who doesn't want a bright and shiny world full of beautiful people with togas and crystal spires and eudaimonia for all? The problem is that [every single time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20186.Seeing_Like_a_State) somebody tries to actually *implement* such a vision, he ends up creating piles of skulls. The \"Great Reset\" is yet another top-down vision for reshaping the world, yet another \"sceme[] to improve the human condition\". Why *shouldn't* we see this vision as yet another looming pile of skulls?\n\nIn particular, the core of the \"Great Reset\" is [ensuring equality of outcome](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/great-reset-must-place-social-justice-centre/). It's about moving pricing power from the market to a [committee](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/opinion/sunday/women-pay-gender-gap.html). The Great Reset is not just about \"continuing economic growth after a pandemic\". It's about using our present crisis as a vehicle to \"fix\" the world economy so that it aligns with the Utopian vision of the donor-tech-media-academic elite. And it just so happens that all attempts to \"fix\" society to align with the intelligentsia's idea of Utopia end up creating as byproducts mountains of skulls.

Mostly when it came to being bullied i would do just that, but it really didnt solve anything. I would just continue to be bullied. As i got older the consequences of ever defending myself only seemed to get worse. This got to a point where around middle school i was terrified of my own anger. I was so afraid i would get angry at someone and do something that would ruin my life forever. All the while i was still being bullied, like they were egging me on everyday.\n\nI cannot begin to describe what its like to be afraid of yourself. There is without a doubt no worse feeling (atleast in my experiance). On top of that the only way i was ever taught to deal with it was just to walk away. I was isolated, angry, and it felt like there was no one out there who could really understand the way my mind worked. Everyday i went to school i knew i would be bullied, and i knew i just had to take it, or ruin my life and get expelled for fighting.\n\nI continued to let that kinda of fear run my life until my junior year of HS. Somebody had spit on my car, and i snapped. I drove to their house and banged on their door threatening to curb stomp the kid who did it. Luckily he hid in his house and the only penalty that came of it was a police report. But after that day people just stopped bullying me. I think once i finally let people see that anger they realized i could only take so much before it all came out in the form of violence.\n\nIf you ever see a young kid with anger issues dont try and make them go away. Anger like that wont just \"go away\", it will destroy them if they feel like a ticking time bomb for their whole lives. Help them find something that they can channel their anger into. For me it was wrestling, i found combat sports when i was in kindergarden, and if i didnt have that release where i could use that anger to be good at something, it would've just manifested to the point where i became suicidal.\n\nIm in college now, and i realized a few years ago that my anger is something i should be afraid of, but it is also a tool. That anger is where i get my drive, passion, and its given me some of the best experiances in my life through wrestling. Without that anger i wouldnt be the person i am today. Im proud of who i am, so in a way im thankful for this fucked up disposition.\n\nTL;DR: young boys with anger issues need help. Dont scald them for being angry, and dont try and make it go away. Just fucking help them."}, {"text": "No problem. Let me know if you change your mind."}, {"text": "I like to look at it when I want a laugh and jaw dropping/insane opinion"}]}

He at least respected our rules. He left and burned us for $750 bucks, and right before our daughter was born. Love him, but never again.\n\nMy mom on the other hand...we were trying to get her out of the area she grew up in and all the druggy friends. She came to us when our daughter was born to help watch her so we didn't have to drop 1200 a month on daycare. Every day was a fight. Zero consideration for our rules and expectations, spent any money we have her on beer and cigarettes instead of saving any to pay her fines and get a car. She was always challenging us on how we wanted to raise our daughter. My mom also fights dirty, saying the most vile, hurtful things at the drop of a hat. Eventually I started seeing a shrink because I was anxiety ridden every waking moment. We eventually gave her 30 days notice to get out, and I told her she could visit our kids, but we would NEVER open our home/help her or any family again.\n\nIt kills me, because I was the kid that got out of my families rutt. I've always felt it was my job to pull them up...but now I realize, I have to take care of my wife and daughter. I can't let them keep using me. They still call under the pretext of wanting to talk to our kid and play smalltalk...but it always comes around to money, and the conversation always wraps up quick when I just say absolutely NO.\n\nHurts every time.

I had a guy try to talk me out of finishing my undergrad degree and then insist I was doing well because 'women have it easier'. I had a guy who insisted I 'ask him questions' about our mutual work topic at which I knew more than him about. I had another guy who saw me make one small mistake, fixed it, told everyone how he should have my job and that he deserves my salary. He was always on standby to complain when he saw something he can do better. Guys who have higher SMV than me were always the ones to build me up.

Although I do write and use various scripts in multiple programming languages as a small part of my job.\n\nI will give you the advise that I got from my teachers. I was lucky to have 2 excellent teachers for Computer Science. One was in my school, the other was the legendary [Prof D B Phatak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepak_B._Phatak) in IIT Bombay. And both of them had similar advice for starting off as a programmer.\n\nDo not waste your time learning the intricate details of various programming languages - even the best programmers use Google to get their syntaxes &amp; commands right. What you need is to train yourself on how to think logically and tackle the problem at hand. If you have the algorithm devised in the form of a flowchart, then you have solved 80% of the problem. The rest you can Google.\n\nProf Phatak used to tell us this. And he would actually give us 60% of the marks in our exams if we could just write down the solution to the problem step-by-step in Plain English, another 20% if we could draw out a flowchart, and the rest 20% if we could write the program correctly.\n\nSo, in short, first learn Boolean Algebra &amp; Logical reasoning. Train yourself to properly look at &amp; disseminate problems. If you can comfortably do this, then you will be able to master any programming language.\n\nRemember, a programming language is just a media for you to give instructions to the computer in a language it understands; but before that you need to be able to think of the problem and the solution in your language - English, Hindi or whatever your mother tongue is!"}]}

When he's a 5 with a 5 on him, he gets that opportunity often.  But on the 76ers they have bad spacing to bein with.  And he was often covered by 4's, because he was playing 4.  4's are much more willing to go to the arc to block a shot than a center.  And 4's are much faster than centers.\n\nThe end result was that Horford was rushing his shot almost every time.  And even on the shots where he had time, he still rushed it because he was so thrown off.  Can't teach an old dog new tricks.\n\nHe's a GREAT 3 point shooter as a Center.  He's a below league average shooter playing a 4, guarded by a 4.\n\nI think he'll be in the league for years to come.  If he wants he can play for a long time.  He's a smart guy.  He's in shape.  And he can shoot, and do some short-mid range stuff like the baby hook.  \n\nThe vast majority of the reason he sucked this year is because the 76ers tried to convert him from a center to a volume 3 point shooting 4.  I honestly feel bad for him.  Glad he got to move on."}]}

They literally got their act together at Aprils wedding to another man while Jackson was dating another woman for crying out loud. Like I said, after that they had a few months of being ok and then after the loss of their son they understandably went though a rocky period. That said even the way they dealt with that was horrible. I'm not placing blame on either because people deal with grief differently but you can tell a lot about a relationship with how they grieve together and how a relationship survives grief. their entire relationship was built on the idea that they were great friends who had nothing in common and who's relationship suffered because of it, \n\nI'm not even going to address the complete biased look at Jaggie here. Of course Jackson was there for her as a friend in the same way that he would have been there for April as a friend if her mother had died before they had started having romantic feeling for each other. I don't get how that invalidates the romantic feelings they had for each other later. And no, I don't like Jaggie, they were ill fitted for each other as well. \n\nSo while you may disagree, please respect that I feel differently.

You can get a dedicated backpacking bag from a company like Osprey for similar or less money and it will fit that purpose far better than the Direct Action bag will.  And I think they can comfortably double as a bug out bag.\n\nTake all this with a grain of salt cuz its just, like, one guys opinion, but I've seen lots of smaller framed people ruck 50L loaded bags with a great deal of comfort by having the right bag and I've seen 220lb muscle bound comrades piss and moan about a 30L ruck after a few miles hike because it's not designed and doesn't fit properly."}]}

Then I'm sorry I don't know why it has to be specifically a doll.

I think it makes a lot of sense.\n\n&gt;Can the mind of an old man comprehend the memories and thoughts of a Maiar? \n\nThis is a good point, and two theories pop up in my head:\n\n**1. The body of an old man physically can't contain all the knowledge and full consciousness of a Maia.** This kind of reminds me of a less extreme version of the scene in Altered Carbon Season 1, where the rich lady effectively lobotomizes a human by putting his stack (consciousness) into the body of a snake, and then back into a human, only to find him catatonic. I guess another way of looking at it is like lossy image/music compression, where by taking the original data and putting it into a lesser-sized format, the quality gets irreversibly lowered.\n\nAside from these analogies, I think it makes sense, as any of the Istari would have started out as lesser Ainur, who surely must've had a good idea of the Music of the Ainur. This passage from the Ainulindale refers to the Valar, but I think it can be extrapolated to Maiar as well:\n\n&gt;\" ...many of the greatest and most fair, took the leave of Il\u00favatar and descended into it. But this condition Il\u00favatar made, or it is the necessity of their love, that their power should henceforth be contained and bounded in the World, to be within it for ever, so that they are its life and it is theirs.\"\n\nThere was another passage stating that even \"bound\" to Arda, the Valar and Maiar are incorporeal beings, and that they can take any form they choose, but if they stay in a form too long and do things they weren't supposed to do (like dominating the Children of Il\u00favatar). I take to basically mean that if they become too secular, they become literally confined by it, in an earthly body. If their physical bodies become \"confined\", it's not much of a stretch to say that their minds do as well.\n\n**2. The body of an old man can fully contain a Maia's consciousness, but millennia passing by just make older events seem more trivial.**\n\nIt's possible that the Istari's memories aren't deliberately wiped or obfuscated upon entering Middle Earth, but that they just matter less to them over time, with smaller details forgotten. After all, Gandalf seemed to recognize Durin's Bane as a \"Flame of Ud\u00fbn (Utumno)\", which he shouldn't if that part of his memory was wiped. After being reborn as Gandalf the White, he says \"I have forgotten much that I thought I knew, and learned again much that I had forgotten.\" Gandalf was in Middle Earth for a little over 2,000 years by the War of the Ring, and maybe things done in the past just matter less? Take for example, our high school selves. I don't know about you, but my social life at my school was the world to me. Barely anything else mattered at the time. But of course a decade later, having gone through college, professional school, and entering the workforce, anything that happened in high school seems so trivial and pointless. I know that it was hugely important to me then, but now, I don't even remember my class's valedictorian's name, or the names of most of my HS crushes.\n\nIt might also explain why some other Maiar like Sauron and the Balrogs were able to be corrupted by Melkor and his discord. After hundreds and thousands of years, maybe they just stopped caring about the Music of the Ainur and instead just did whatever they wanted in the  sandbox that was Middle Earth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Just wandering around for centuries working to complete his task and go back to the home he can\u2019t remember lol what the fuck. \n\nEspecially for Saruman and Radagast (as well as the two Blue Wizards), I think this is especially true. With a dimmed memory of Valinor, \"what the fuck\" is what they all probably thought eventually. Saruman obviously abandoning his quest in the most egregious way, trying to take power for himself.\n\nI know I'm just speaking personally, but if I were Saruman, and I **did** have my memories of the paradise that is Valinor, I'd totally be 100% on task and be like \"Get the job done ASAP to get the hell out of this comparative s\\*\\*thole!\"\n\nSorry for rambling. Those were just some of my thoughts after reading what you said!"}, {"text": "You need to read the Silmarillion."}, {"text": "the world needs more people who get high and think about Middle Earth like you do \ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffb"}, {"text": "I just finished the Silmarillion, so i hope it will be accurate what i'll write rn.\n\nThere was another maiar, in Middle Earth - Melian was her name. (Names are maybe kinda different in english - i read it in my language) She was in human body, but she knew everything about her life before. She also went out of her body before doriath was destroyed. She was probably stronger maiar than Gandalf, and was in younger body, but still i think the body doesn't really affect maiars' memories. (Melian is ascendor of elrond btw.) Also, another maiar is Sauron himself. He could change the view of his body just as he wanted in second age, but then Lost this ability. So there's two different maiars who could change their bodies and it didn't affect their memories. It's possible that he had memories on Valinor, but just couldn't or didn't want to share them with others. Also it's possible that Valar made him forget Valinor on purpose."}]}

Capella is nice, but the dude has a definite ceiling. While I get the love for him, the dude can be played off the court. The hope prior to that was that John could develop defensively to be a great small ball 5, but that was always gonna be based a lot of hoping\n\nWith Onyeka, that's not a concern. He has a lot of what we like in John with touch that's a little worse. That said, his potential on defense is legit and has been a legit impact defender. Hali would have been cool too, but Onyeka also has much higher upside. The other thing that makes me excited is that the dude is a high energy player. Having a dude that can bring that type of intensity to the defensive side of the ball is huge for the Hawks who had a big issue there. Also, having your defensive floor general be your 5 just makes more sense from a communication perspective\n\nFinally, this dude has more star potential than either Hali or Deni do. We'll see how it all plays out, but TITS and ASS seem like a good play for today"}, {"text": "This is so cool! Thanks :)"}, {"text": "I wonder too.

I started going to community college and I had a couple remedial classes (because I was super sick when I took the placement test to see where I was at). I started going for business because I wanted to have a mobile auto detailing truck as a business. After taking a business class, I realized that I didn't need it nor did I like it. And my GPA was around 2.0. I switched to a general education major with a plan to go into engineering. That time in my life wasn't really a good time to go to college as I had other things going on that were more important. I decided to drop out temporarily so I wouldn't be stuck with failed classes and low scores. I got a job and I didn't get a lot of hours so I started driving an hour each way to work at a car dealership/body shop. I transferred to a closer location but ended up having to go back. I decided that I was going to go back to college because I was starting to hate this job. I went back. Took one engineering class and didn't like it. And having quite a few failed classes from the past to fix, I felt hopeless. And with a car payment, I decided to leave again and get my old job back. I got a new job at a local dealership and I ended up walking away after a few weeks (long story). I figured out that even though I'm a car guy, I don't want to work with cars. My best advice would be to get a general idea of what you want and go from there. For example, say you want to be a doctor. Check out and see what they do. Shadow one for a day and ask every question you have. Then see if you can follow a couple students that are studying in that area for a day. I say this because it likely will be cheap and won't cost anything. You'll have an idea of what it's like and you wouldn't be wasting time and money going to school and not knowing for what or why. The doctor thing is just an example. You could do that with a police officer, plumber, chef, electrician, engineer, mechanic. And as far as age goes, it really doesn't matter. There's people of all ages in college. Some people there are 17 others are 67. Honestly 25 really isn't that much older than most students. But knowing what you DON'T want to do is a step in the right direction of knowing that you want to do."}, {"text": "If only she was intelligent."}]}

Like I said, after that they had a few months of being ok and then after the loss of their son they understandably went though a rocky period. That said even the way they dealt with that was horrible. I'm not placing blame on either because people deal with grief differently but you can tell a lot about a relationship with how they grieve together and how a relationship survives grief. their entire relationship was built on the idea that they were great friends who had nothing in common and who's relationship suffered because of it, \n\nI'm not even going to address the complete biased look at Jaggie here.

And no, I don't like Jaggie, they were ill fitted for each other as well. \n\nSo while you may disagree, please respect that I feel differently. Jackson and April were great as friends, the minute the show made them romantic they became toxic as f*ck to each other and themselves."}, {"text": "West"}, {"text": "Never run that bag, so couldn't tell you if it works or not, looking at the build and coming from a backpacking background, I'm guessing it's not going to be too terribly comfortable for actually backpacking out of.  I can't find anywhere that it has an internal frame, so everything is just sort of supported by the bag itself, which means its all going to pull and hang off of you.  \n\nIf you are looking for something that is actually comfortable to backpack in and are going to be spending around that much money, I would personally go with something designed for the purpose.  You can get a dedicated backpacking bag from a company like Osprey for similar or less money and it will fit that purpose far better than the Direct Action bag will.  And I think they can comfortably double as a bug out bag.\n\nTake all this with a grain of salt cuz its just, like, one guys opinion, but I've seen lots of smaller framed people ruck 50L loaded bags with a great deal of comfort by having the right bag and I've seen 220lb muscle bound comrades piss and moan about a 30L ruck after a few miles hike because it's not designed and doesn't fit properly."}]}

Even though I was uncomfortable with the idea of finding a significant other, it always felt like I had some kind of duty to settle for someone and have children.  Growing up My mom was always very vocal about wanting the grandbabies and my dad seems to have the impression that you need to have kids to take care of you when you're older. In high school I even pulled a Napoleon Dynamite and pretended that I was in a long distance relationship with someone in an attempt to seem normal amongst my friends who all seemed to have pretty intense relationships at the time.  I had a friend who told me when she couldn't wait for a guy to pop my cherry, as though that was equivalent to falling in love.\n\nI didn't start dating until I was almost 23 but I can't say I've ever gotten much enjoyment out of it.  Even though I'm very open about needing a fairly autonomous relationship, most guys seem to expect that to last 3 days before it sparks into a whirlwind romance and become frustrated when it doesn't.  I've had guys say they knew I was the one at first sight, ask if it's a religious thing, offer to help me masturbate and other dumb shit.  I know that's not necessarily to be unexpected, it's more that I have to wonder if I'm being duped by some simp whos expecting us to be a sitcom coupled even though I've told him it's not going to happen.\n\nI'm not currently seeing anyone, 2020 has been stressful enough as it is and I have better things to do then go looking for love.  Though I do hope to find a SO I'm comfortable being in a relationship with one day, it doesn't really concern me to think that it may never happen.  I don't know many people who are comfortable with the idea of being without a partner, but I always have to wonder if I'm missing something because a majority of my friends seem miserable with their longtime SOs.  \n\nSorry this turned into a rant, but the more I started thinking about it the more I wondered if anyone could relate."}, {"text": "Military hardware (generally WWII, but not exclusively) being turned into anime girls.\n\n Arpeggio of Blue Steel had the ships themselves turning into women of various....avatars sizes.

I still did my best to provide a great onboarding experience by providing new associates the skills they needed to be successful, but the quality of new hires fell off the board.. (Go figure). We went from the region with the lowest turnover rates in our company to one of the highest, and current employee morale plummeted because of strict limit in pay raises, (but hey at least we saved a couple hundred bucks a day in labor costs..) I stuck around for a few more years, but by the end I was so done with flaky new employees that my passion for teaching and mentoring all but disappeared..\n\nOnly until very recently has my passion for teaching and developing others returned (working on my Master\u2019s in IT System management), and it feels like I\u2019ve been reunited with a long lost love."}, {"text": "Thanks,\nWould you have any experience with Windows Server Essentials Experience Role to replace AzureADConnect+Exchange?"}]}

I spoke too generally :) as can happen when one mixes up the idea of value and price in whole relation to production and not merely as a byproduct of other established forms of socially necessary labor time.\n\nIt's my understanding that something like use-value is not a measure of actual value itself but merely a matter of pricing something to satisfy the idea of exchange as being satisfactory to the buyer (I pay $10 for a coat that costs $2 to make because I presume that exchanges are based on need rather than fair exchange of $ to produce vs $ to purchase)."}, {"text": "[deleted]"}, {"text": "Mod system is much better now.

The second time, I woke up as they were doing the ablation and I felt everything, the burning, the searing, the smell of burnt flesh and smoke. I started thrashing on the table and the last thing I remember hearing is \"HOLD HER DOWN!\" as the veins were being cauterized.
